# asteroids
Asteroids was my submission for a projct in my first semester, as part of the programming module for the first year of my Computer Science BSc.

We were tasked with developing a simple project in p5.js. Asteroids is a simple clone of the 1979 Arcade game Asteroids. 

Whilst I am not completely happy with all of the code as it is now, that is because I learned a great deal from this project about how to structure a program well, about the basics of physics engines, and creating clean, concisely purposed methods.

I am especially proud of the research I had to do on circle and line segmentation collision detection, in order to do the collision tests between the ship and asteroids. Additonally his research led me to produce a presentation about collision detection for another module, for which I received a grade of 100%.

**I received a First Class grade for this project, at 80%.**

If you would like to download this for yourself, you will need to use the p5.js, p5.sound.js and p5.dom.js libraries, including all the sfx I used which unfortunately I am not hosting.

You can play the game at [polyrogue.com](http://polyrogue.com/aM/index.html)
